/*
Write a JS program to generate a random number and store 
it in a variable. The program then takes an input from the 
user to tell them whether the guess was correct , greater 
or less than the original number. 100 - (no. of guesses) is 
the score of the user. The program is expected to terminate 
once the number is guessed. Number should be between 1-100.
